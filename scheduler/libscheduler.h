  the order they are to be scheduled. Furthermore, we have also listed the
  current state of the job (either running on the processor or idle). For
  example, if we have a non-preemptive algorithm and job(id=4) has began
  running, job(id=2) arrives with a higher priority, and job(id=1) arrives with
  a lower priority, the output in our sample output will be:
